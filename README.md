**Peer Reviewer Name:**

**Case Team Reviewed:**

Please provide thoughtful and honest feedback on the case study report assigned.  
Keep in mind the describe - evaluate - suggest framework we talked about in
class.

Use as much space as needed to answer the questions below. In your answers, make
sure that your response is phrased **as if you were writing a formal review**.

1.  Is the introduction effective? Think about whether the paper clearly 
articulates the authors' goals, questions, and whether they are appropriate for
the overall goal of the case study. Is the data well-described?

2.  Is the proposed methodology sufficient and effective for answering the
research questions? Are models clearly specified using correct mathematical
notation? Is the methodology clear enough to be replicated by another
researcher? Is the model appropriately validated, with diagnostics and
assumptions discussed appropriately?

3.  Is all interpretation of the results correct and free of errors, with all
needed information included? Are the results presented in an effective and
clean way?

4.  Is the discussion effective in answering the overall research goals based
on the presented results? Have sensitivity analysis been done and are they
reasonable? Are discussion of limitations and future work reasonable?

5.  Is the paper professionally presented and generally free of distracting 
errors or other issues, including (but not limited to) insufficient organization 
or formatting; poor grammar, spelling, or punctuation; or too-small font? Is 
the overall paper easily readable for someone with your expert level of 
knowledge? Note any concerns here.

6.	What are the strengths and limitations of the analysis?  Are they clearly 
acknowledged and presented in the manuscript? What is the most interesting 
part of the author's approach to you, and why? Do you have any general 
suggestions for improvement or questions for the author? 

7.	If you had to go back and improve your own submission after giving feedback 
to this submission, what would you change?

8.	Is the analysis easily reproduced based on the code (R file) and original
data? How long did it take you to reproduce this work, from start to finish 
(including downloading files, opening software, etc)? What challenges to
reproducibility did you face, if any?
